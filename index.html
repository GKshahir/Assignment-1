				<h2>Introduction</h2>
			</header>
			
			
			<p>Currently studying bachelors of IT in RMIT, being a game freek it's tough to handle this kind of studies. So I guess it's needless to say now that my hobby is gaming. I am always
				into sports and gaming. I have been a great football follower and a huge fan of FC BARCELONA and LEO MESSI. 
				It's my dream to develop a game of my own which will help people connect throughout the world.</p>

					<h3>Interest in IT</h3>
					<p>My interst in IT has always been for game development. It started back when I was a student of class 5. A
					tiny little boy playing games all the time wanted to make a game for himself. This interest developed within myself long ago then 
				        when I got olden I came to know that IT was the best option for me to be a game developer, hearing from people and researching websites 
					I made a decision to study in IT. Currently I don't have any IT experience but soon enough I will start attending events and gather experience for myself.</p>
					
					<p>As RMIT is among the top universities in Australia, it encourages student to make their mark on the world through unique study experiences.
RMIT also has free study support which is actually the expert advice on writing skills, presentation skills which will allow me to improve my study techniques. The most important part for which I am mainly interested in studying in RMIT is that I will be able to learn from internationally recognized experts and also from the established industry leaders, research innovators which is the biggest opportunity I do not want to miss.
</p>
					<p>I expect to learn different coding languages, networking, graphics designing, software developing, Unity 3D, cloud computing etc.
						and other basics including communication skills, group works etc. I expect to learn to be a consistent performer.</p>

					<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
					<p>As I want to make a game for myself, so I would like to start from the basic being a software or a game developer in a growing
				        company. Here's a link of a job I might be interested on "https://www.seek.com.au/job/36902485?type=standout".
				        This kind of job will help me learn more and I will find myself enough time and experience to work on developing my own game
					later.</p>
					
					<p>This job requires a programmer which is the perfect position for me to apply for. I am always interested in doing coding typing the micro stuff in my 
					laptop. Doing programming is a dream for every game developer i suppose! This is what this position makes me more appealing.</p>
					
					<p>I will have to be very comfortable with the coding languages which includes JAVA, JAVAscript, HTML, jquery etc. and will also have
						to have great knowledge on working with gaming engine such as UNITY 3D. Database and data structure as well as Entity Framework all these will 
						have to be my daily basic needs to work in this company as a programmer. As they work as a team and won't prefer micro-manage, I will 
						have help and companions out there to work in a friendly enviornment. I am always interested in learning and doing new things. This company also started a 
						project in developing their first game and will work on more in future so, I will have an oppurtinity to learn and start fresh than being in a very big renowned company at 
						the early stages of my career.</p>
					        
					<p>Doing my bachelors here in RMIT I will cover most of the skillset required for my above mentioned job. But attending in various hackathon and other
						programming events I will gain experience and practice more and more codes very often each day to make myself a beast in programming. I am a fast learner
						and very ambitious in studying new things related to IT and programming. This will help me to give more time in programming and developing experience. I have planned to do online courses
						related to programming. All these I will continue to do in my free-time while doing bachelors. As a result in three years time I will have enough experience and online course certificates along with my bachelor
						degree I will make myself prepared to have a job like this.</p>

				<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
			</header>			  
			<p>Really anything that continues to push me further...</p>
			<p>... But to answer the question I would be looking at a Business Analyst role or Security Consultant in the future.
			I'm very much interested in the security field and business management, so I'd hope to move into one of those areas and continue learning of the many different facets of IT.
			While interested in transitioning into one of those fields, I would hope to have time available to allow for me to stay within the education sector.</p>
